# What?

A browser source that displays images and information from a SuperRare artist's gallery at 1920x1080 to use on Twitch streams as a background when chatting or if you're away from the channel.

Includes a simple bot to reply to commands in the chat.

This is early and messy and prototype-y, so don't expect too much. More information will appear here eventually.
